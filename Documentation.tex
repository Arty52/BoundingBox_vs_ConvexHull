%=================== Questions =====================
\noindent
\textbf{Questions:} \\
\textbf{a.} Is there a noticeable difference in the performance of the two algorithms? Which is faster, and by how much? Does this surprise you? \\

\hangindent=0.2in
Yes; there was a noticeable difference between the two algorithms.  The \emph{bounding box} algorithm is faster by 99.66\% for $n = 20$ and 99.99\% faster for $n=200$.  This result is not surprising, considering the \emph{bounding box} algorithm only uses 1 for-loop. The single for-loop is used to find the points with the minimum and maximum values for $x$ and $y$.  Whereas the \emph{convex hull} algorithm uses 3 for-loops, has to calculate a line between two points, find it's slope, and then compare all other points to the line determining whether or not the line is part of the hull.\\

\noindent
\textbf{b.} What is the efficiency class of each of your algorithms, according to your own mathematical analysis? (You are not required to include all your math work, just state the classes you derived and proved.) \\

\hangindent=0.2in
The derivation for our pseudocode for the \emph{bounding box} problem comes out to be $O(n)$.  The derivation of our pseudocode of the \emph{convex hull} problem comes out to be $O(n^3)$. \\

\noindent
\textbf{c.} Are the fit lines on your scatter plots consistent with these efficiency classes? Justify your answer. \\

\hangindent=0.2in
The best-fit line for our \emph{bounding box} function was very linear, possible errors include machine timing errors. The best-fit line for our \emph{convex hull} graph was cubic, possible errors include machine timing errors. We mathematically derived the time efficiency classes from our pseudocode to be $O(n)$ and $O(n^3)$, then we used the \emph{Excel} software to graph and calculate the best-fit line for our data points.  The best-fit lines came out to be $O(n)$ and $O(n^3)$ for the bounding box and convex hull, respectively, which is consistent with our mathematically derived efficiency classes. \\

\noindent
\textbf{d.} Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with the hypothesis stated on the first page? Justify your answer. \\

\hangindent=0.2in
Our evidence was consistent with the hypothesis; \\ \\\emph{``For large values of n, the mathematically-derived efficiency class of an algorithm accurately predicts the observed running time of an implementation of that algorithm"} \\ \\The observed running times of our graphs came out to be equivalent with the derived efficiency classes.  After using \emph{Excel} to calculate the best-fit line, we compared it to that of our efficiency classes derived from the pseudocode.  Our test data came out to be within the same big-$O$ efficiency class as our derived big-$O$ classes. \\
